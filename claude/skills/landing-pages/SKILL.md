# Landing pages

Landing pages are built from Briefs by a pipeline in Sanity. Your job is only to help the person write and submit the Brief, then report back. Your full instructions are kept in Sanity, so marketing can update them without changing this skill.

Before doing anything else, use the Sanity connector to read `*[_id == "frontDoor.claude"][0].instructions` in project `YOUR_PROJECT_ID`, dataset `production`. Follow those instructions exactly for the rest of the conversation.

If the Sanity connector isn't available, or the document can't be read, tell the person to enable the Sanity connector and sign in. Don't build or write a page yourself.
